### Project Overview
This study explores the relationships between **economic indicators** (GDP, unemployment, remittances, income/spending) and the **cost of living** as a strategy to improve understanding of global socioeconomic trends.  
It evaluates how immigration patterns affect economies and lifestyles across nations, using advanced data analysis and visualization.  

Key objective: To reveal how economic stability, living costs, and immigration interplay in shaping global development.

### Data Source
Datasets were taken from **Kaggle**:
1. Worldwide Immigration Dataset (JSON)  
2. Worldwide Economic Indicators Dataset (JSON)  
3. Worldwide Cost of Living & Income Dataset (CSV)

---

### Major Steps Followed
1. Fetching unstructured datasets (JSON/CSV) from Kaggle  
2. Storing JSON datasets in **MongoDB**  
3. Storing structured CSV dataset in **PostgreSQL**  
4. Data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation in Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
5. Outlier detection using boxplots  
6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
7. Merging all three datasets on **country** and **year**  
8. Exporting combined dataset into CSV  
9. Loading CSV into **PowerBI** for visualizations  
10. Building an interactive **PowerBI dashboard**

### Insights and Findings
1. **Immigration Trends (1990‚Äì2020):**  
   Immigration grew steadily, with an acceleration after 2000, showing how nations with stronger economies attract more migrants.

3. **Remittance Dependence:**  
   In countries such as Lesotho, migrant remittances account for 80%+ of GDP, showing heavy reliance on foreign income.

4. **Cumulative Dashboard:**  
   Key economic indicators: GDP ($198K), GDP growth rate (2.30%), average cost of living ($4.12K), and average immigrants (7.59K).

### Conclusion and Further Scope
- **GDP:** Year-on-year fluctuations, with major drops during global crises (2008, 2020).  
- **Regional Trends:** North America shows the highest educational costs, while Africa remains the lowest.  
- **Immigration & Economy:** Immigration drives GDP growth and remittance flows, though remittances form just 0.67% of GDP.  
- **Policy Impact:** Results stress the need for balanced policies to manage economic growth, contain rising costs, and reduce regional inequalities.  

This project provides a foundation for **evidence-based policymaking** on global economic stability and improved standards of living.
